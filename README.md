# Supply-chain-management-dashboard

This project focuses on implementing a machine learning-based solution for optimizing supply chain management, specifically through demand forecasting. Using a dataset from a fashion and beauty startup, it incorporates features such as product type, sales, customer demographics, lead times, manufacturing costs, and shipping details. The workflow involves data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and one-hot encoding categorical variables. A neural network model with multiple layers is then built to predict demand, trained using historical sales and other influencing factors. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error, with visualizations such as scatter plots to compare true versus predicted values. The project also includes a Streamlit dashboard for real-time visualization and analysis of supply chain metrics, aiding in better decision-making. Ultimately, this system supports optimizing inventory, reducing stockouts, and enhancing overall supply chain efficiency.
